### Component System

- Uses **Shadcn/UI** component library with "new-york" style (15 components implemented)
- Components built on **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** for type-safe variant management
- Consistent design system with CSS variables for theming
- Member dashboard with 8 functional views and state-based navigation

### Styling Approach

- **Tailwind CSS** with CSS variables for theming
- Color scheme based on `zinc` with dark mode support
- Component variants defined using CVA patterns
- Global styles in `src/app/globals.css`

## Development Patterns

### Component Creation

- Follow Shadcn/UI patterns for new components
- Use CVA for variant management when creating reusable components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces with `VariantProps`
- Include `forwardRef` for components that accept refs

### Form Handling

- Use React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas
- Leverage the form components from Shadcn/UI
- Follow controlled component patterns

### Utility Functions

- Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- Prefer utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS classes

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- **Next.js 15 Project Setup**: Complete with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and App Router
- **Shadcn/UI Component Library**: 15 core components implemented (Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, Checkbox, Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Form, Input, Label, Separator, Calendar, Progress, Select)
- **Member Dashboard System**: Complete member-focused dashboard with 8 functional views and state-based navigation
- **Dashboard Views**: Dashboard Overview, Courses, Community, Events, Resources, Insights, Live Streams, Profile
- **Elite Business Coaching Branding**: Professional business coaching theme with appropriate content and terminology
- **Professional Landing Page**: Hero section, features showcase, pricing tiers, and call-to-action with modern design
- **Code Quality Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged fully configured with automated pre-commit hooks
- **Project Structure**: Organized route groups for auth, dashboard, and public pages with complete implementation
- **Layout Components**: Header, Navbar, Footer, and Sidebar components with responsive design
- **Form Infrastructure**: Contact form and authentication form components ready for integration

#### **Technical Achievements**:
- State-based dashboard navigation (prevents 404 errors)
- Member-focused UI/UX design philosophy
- Comprehensive component architecture with reusable patterns
- Elite Business Coaching Community branding throughout

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Authentication (READY TO START)

- **Authentication Forms**: Login and registration form UI components created and styled
- **Route Structure**: Complete authentication routes prepared (login, register, forgot-password)
- **Dashboard Integration**: Member dashboard ready for authentication connection
- **API Routes**: Placeholder API routes for auth, users, subscriptions, and webhooks
- **Planned Integration**: NextAuth.js v5, PostgreSQL/Prisma, Zod validation schemas, and React Hook Form integration

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features (Upcoming Phases)

- Tiered membership subscriptions with Stripe integration
- Content management system with access gating
