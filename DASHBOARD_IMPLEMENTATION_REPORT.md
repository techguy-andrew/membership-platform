## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. Navigation 404 Errors
**Issue**: Dashboard sidebar navigation was causing 404 errors when clicking between sections.
**Root Cause**: Next.js routing attempting to navigate to non-existent routes.
**Solution**: Implemented state-based view switching within single page component.
**Result**: Seamless navigation with no errors.

### 2. Quick Actions Card Layout
**Issue**: Quick Actions card was disrupting dashboard layout and didn't align with member-focused experience.
**Root Cause**: Component designed for admin functionality rather than member engagement.
**Solution**: Removed Quick Actions card and adjusted layout to focus on member analytics.
**Result**: Cleaner, more focused dashboard layout.

### 3. Blog to Insights Transformation
**Issue**: Generic "Blog" naming didn't fit member-focused experience.
**Root Cause**: Administrative perspective in initial design.
**Solution**: Renamed to "Insights" with focus on personal analytics and progress tracking.
**Result**: More relevant and engaging member experience.

### 4. Admin to Member Perspective Shift
**Issue**: Initial dashboard designed from admin perspective.
**Root Cause**: Standard dashboard patterns focused on management rather than engagement.  
**Solution**: Complete UI/UX transformation focusing on member value and engagement.
**Result**: Member-centric experience with personal progress and community focus.
